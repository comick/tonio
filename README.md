Tonio is the free juke-box software for children and beyond
===========================================================

Inspired by commercial success of _toniesÂ®_, Tonio is the limitless free software alternative for makers with a legacy.

The project consists of Tonio daemon software, implementing Jukebox functionality, and a carefully crafted Buildroot external configuration for selected boards.


Key features
============

Tonio turns RFID tags into keys for playing audio playlists.

It supports anything that `libvlc` can play, streaming included.

- Tonio is free software released under the terms of GNU General Public License 3
- Tonio is _creative_ by default
- Tonio is DRM-free
- Tonio boots in few seconds, courtesy of Buildroot

Super simple human interface design:

- lay an RFID tag on RFID sensitive area -> play
- move tag away from sensitive area -> pause
- buttons for next/previous track
- buttons for volume up/down


Getting started from source
===========================

This is guiding through getting started from sources. If you want to get started from pre-built images, take a look to the [wiki Quick Start page](https://github.com/comick/tonio/wiki/Quick-Start).

Supported hardware
------------------

- Boards
 - Raspberry Pi 3
 - Raspberry Pi 0 Wireless (fat kernel, untested audio)
- RC522 RFID
- Push buttons for volume and track control (optional)


Wiring things together
----------------------

Push buttons wiring is configured in `tonio.h` header.
Here are the default settings, using `wiringPi` pin numbering:

```
#PIN_PREV 1
#define PIN_NEXT 4

#define PIN_VOL_DOWN 29
#define PIN_VOL_UP 5
```

Tonio daemon assumes SPI interface to RC522, connect accordingly.

[Reference assembly documentation is  under progress in the wiki](https://github.com/comick/tonio/wiki/Reference-Assembly).


Building the root file system
-----------------------------

[Download Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/download.html) and extract into some folder, say `$HOME/buildroot-2020.02.11`.
Version 2020.02.11 is currently used. The project tries to keep current with latest LTS version of Buildroot.

Clone this project in your favorite folder, say `$HOME/tonio`.

```
$ cd $HOME/buildroot-2020.02.11
$ make BR2_EXTERNAL=$HOME/tonio tonio_raspberrypi3_defconfig
$ make
```

> HINT: `raspberry3` is used in this example, but multiple boards are supported, see the `board` folder for the list of those.

wait. Buildroot is building the root image from the ground up, it will take some time. Kind half an hour or more.

When you see your command prompt again, and few lines like:

```
...
INFO: hdimage(sdcard.img): adding partition 'boot' (in MBR) from 'boot.vfat' ...
INFO: hdimage(sdcard.img): adding partition 'rootfs' (in MBR) from 'rootfs.ext4' ...
INFO: hdimage(sdcard.img): adding partition 'library' (in MBR) from 'library.vfat' ...
INFO: hdimage(sdcard.img): writing MBR
```

that means build is done.

Writing image to SD card
------------------------

Root image was built successfully and you SD card image is ready.
First find out your SD card device file, say /dev/sdX, then:

```$ sudo dd if output/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX && sync```

Plug you SD card into the board and switch the device on.

Access Tonio via network
------------------------

Your tonio is up and running and new wireless network should be around: its name is `tonio` and default password `toniocartonio`. Connect to it.

Once associated, access your Tonio web interface at http://tonio.local.
The web interface allows to check Tonio status, read the log and manage playlists.

SSH access is also enabled by default `$ ssh root@tonio.local`. Default password is `tonio`.

> HINT: before building, you may want to add your pub key to `$TONIO_SRC/board/$BOARD_NAME/rootfs_overlay/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` for faster SSH access.

Congratulations, you're done! Time to setup playlists and bind them to RFID tags.


Playlists setup
===============

Open the web interface status section at [http://tonio.local/#status](http://tonio.local/#status).
Now move an unused RFID tag on the sensitive area and wait the status page to shows you the unique tag id, say `${MY_TAG_ID}`.

Until playlist management from web UI is complete, some more work is required.

Media files and playlist are meant to be copied on the `vfat` partition named `TONIO` that Tonio mounts at `/mnt/media/`.
When you place a tag, Tonio daemon looks for the folder `/mnt/media/library/${MY_TAG_ID}`.
If folder is there, the file `/usr/share/tonio/library/${MY_TAG_ID}/${MY_TAG_ID}.m3u` will be played. That's your entry point.
File format is the kinda-standard `m3u`, anything uderstood by vlc can be put there. Make sure both `m3u` and media files are uploaded and paths in `m3u` are correct.

> Hint: web radios also work. Just make sure your tonio is connected to the Internet.

Currently, the web UI only allows you to see the content of playlists. Later, playlist management could be done without requiring the user to unplug the SD card.

> The Buildroot configuration has a very limit set of decoders, only the most commonly used (vorbis, mp3) are enabled.
> If you need more decoding capabilities, make sure decoder packages are enabled before build.


Support and feature requests
============================

Nope. But you can create tickets for the wider audience or fix issues yourself and contribute.
Sure enough, you can also say thanks and show your Tonio at work!


Contributing
============

You're wellcome. Merge requests are the way to go.
Just in case you're out of ideas:

- [ ] First time setup page
- [ ] Finish web UI network config
- [ ] Finalize web interface for ordinary people to setup playlists
- [ ] Move to `pigpio`, maybe abstract gpio layer to support more boards, maybe devfs gpio
- [ ] Supporting/testing more boards (eg: pi zero, orange pi, ...)
- [ ] Strip kernel even more from unused modules and move to static device table to faster build and boot
