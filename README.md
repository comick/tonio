Tonio is the free juke-box software for children and beyond
===========================================================

Inspired by commercial success of _toniesÂ®_, Tonio is the limitless free software alternative for makers with a legacy.

The project consists of Tonio daemon software, implementing Jukebox functionality, and a set of Buildroot external configurations for selected boards.


Key features
============

Tonio turns RFID tags into keys for playing audio playlists.

It supports anything that `libvlc` can play, streaming included.

- Tonio is free software released under the terms of GNU General Public License 3
- Tonio is _creative_ by default
- Tonio is DRM-free
- Tonio boots in few seconds, courtesy of Buildroot

Super simple human interface design:

- lay an RFID tag on RFID sensitive area -> play
- move tag away from sensitive area -> pause
- buttons for next/previous track
- buttons for volume up/down


Getting started
===============

Supported hardware
------------------

- Raspberry PI 3 is the only board tested so far
- RC522 RFID
- Push buttons for volume and track control (optional)


Wiring things together
----------------------

Push buttons wiring is configured in `tonio.h` header.
Here are the default settings, wiring pi pin numbering:

```
#PIN_PREV 1
#define PIN_NEXT 4

#define PIN_VOL_DOWN 29
#define PIN_VOL_UP 5
```

Tonio daemon assumes SPI interface to RC522, connect accordingly.

Reference assembly coming soon! Or maybe not.


Building the root file system
-----------------------------

[Download Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/download.html) and extract into some folder, say `$HOME/buildroot-2020.02.03`.
Version 2020.02.3 was used so far. The project tries to align with current LTS version of Buildroot.

Clone this project in your favorite folder, say `$HOME/tonio`.

> Wireless setup is highly recommended. Assumption is made that your wireless network is WPA2.
> Find out `wpa_supplicant.conf.sample` in desired board `rootfs_overlay/etc/init.d`, change things and copy to `wpa_supplicant.conf`.
> Same for `rootfs_overlay/etc/network/interfaces.sample`. Copy `rootfs_overlay/etc/network/interfaces` and change essid according to your reuirements.
>
> Access point functionality can be offered for initial geek-free setup. Not done yet, see TODO for contributing.

> If you plan to access Tonio via SSH, you may want to add your key by creating `$TONIO_SRC/board/$BOARD_NAME/rootfs_overlay/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

```
$ cd $HOME/buildroot-2020.02.03
$ make BR2_EXTERNAL=$HOME/tonio tonio_pi3_defconfig
$ make
```

wait. Buildroot is building the root image from the ground up, it will take some time. Kind half an hour or more.

When you see your command prompt again, and few lines like:

```
...
INFO: hdimage(sdcard.img): adding partition 'boot' (in MBR) from 'boot.vfat' ...
INFO: hdimage(sdcard.img): adding partition 'rootfs' (in MBR) from 'rootfs.ext4' ...
INFO: hdimage(sdcard.img): adding partition 'library' (in MBR) from 'library.vfat' ...
INFO: hdimage(sdcard.img): writing MBR
```

that means build is done.

Writing image to SD card
------------------------

Root image built successfully and you SD card image is ready.
First find out your SD card device file, say /dev/sdX, then:

```$ sudo dd if output/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX && sync```

Plug you SD card into the board and switch on the device.

If wireless was configured, you should be able to access your Tonio web interface at http://tonio.local.
The web interface allows to check Tonio status, read the log and manage playlists.

SSH access is also enabled by default `$ ssh root@tonio.local`. Password is `tonio`. Or none if you configured access key.

Congratulations, you're done! Time to setup playlists and bind them to RFID tags.


Playlists setup
===============

Open the web interface status section at [http://tonio.local/#status](http://tonio.local/#status).
Now move an unused RFID tag on the sensitive area and wait the status page to shows you the unique tag id, say `${MY_TAG_ID}`.

Until playlist management from web UI is complete, some more work is required.

Media files and playlist are meant to be copied on the `vfat` partition named `TONIO` that Tonio mounts at `/mnt/media/`.
When you place a tag, Tonio daemon looks for the folder `/mnt/media/library/${MY_TAG_ID}`.
If folder is there, the file `/usr/share/tonio/library/${MY_TAG_ID}/${MY_TAG_ID}.m3u` will be played. That's your entry point.
File format is the kinda-standard `m3u`, anything uderstood by vlc can be put there. Make sure both `m3u` and media files are uploaded and paths in `m3u` are correct.

> Hint: web radios also work.

The web UI allows you to see the content of playlists. Later playlist management could be done without requiring the used to unplug the SD card.

> The Buildroot configuration may miss some decoders, only the most commonly used are enabled.
> Should you find some quite common decoder, please feel free to contribute improved buildroot config.


Support and feature requests
============================

Nope. But you can create tickets for the wider audience or fix issues yourself and contribute.


Contributing
============

You're wellcome. Merge requests are the way to go.
Just in case you're out of ideas:

- [ ] Start as Access Point for initial network cofiguration
- [ ] Web interface for ordinary people to setup playlists
- [ ] Rewrite with Ada and SPARK, children stuff can't (absolutely can't!) fail at runtime
- [ ] Move to `pigpio`, maybe abstract gpio layer to support more boards
- [ ] Supporting/testing more boards (eg: pi zero, orange pi, ...)
- [ ] Strip kernel even more from unused modules and move to static device table to faster build and boot
